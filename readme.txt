Basic description
-----------------
Mattari AA is an HTML page that allows you to construct Ayashii World-style ASCII art (AA) in your web browser. It is based around the MS Gothic font, but other monospaced Japanese fonts can be used as much crappier substitutes.

Instructions
------------
To use Mattari AA locally on your machine, unzip the files (making sure the file structure remains exactly as it is in the zip), then open index.html in your web browser of choice. It uses some fancypants CSS, so it will almost certainly be b0rked in browsers that are more than a couple years old - SORRY!

If you click the "Information" bar, some basic info about Mattari AA will appear. The settings on the top right allow you to switch between two different font sizes, as well as choose between a variety of different styles based on several notable Ayashii World board lineages.

On the bottom right is the text area, which is where you can construct your AA. If your display is wide enough, you'll see some guidelines in the background showing you where the 72 character line, 80 character line, and 132 character line are. On Chrome-based browsers the lines will scroll as you scroll, but Firefox haet scroll. (;´Д`)

On the left there are two sections containing buttons:
- the top section lets you select a page of buttons to be displayed in the bottom section
- the bottom section displays the current page of buttons - clicking these buttons will insert the character depicted on the button to the text area on the right

NOTE: The first button press will insert the character at your current cursor location in the text area, but any subsequent button presses will insert the character at the very end of the text body until you re-position the cursor in the text area. This is obviously a bug and is totally annoying, but I don't know how to fix it. ヽ(´ー｀)ノ

When you're done with your masterpiece, just select everything in the text area and copypaste the contents into your favorite Ayashii World bulletin board's post form. Once you hit the post button, you must await your appraisal. If you get told your AA sucks, try a little harder next time!

Support (lol)
-------------
If you have any issues with Mattari AA, take a trip down to Strange World@Heyuri (https://ayashii.net) and politely ask / demand / rage about whatever it is, and I'll probably see it. If the issue is related to JavaScript, praying may be more effective.
